Today I learned about membership and identity operators in Python. 
These operators are used to check relationships between values and objects in a program. Understanding these operators helped me improve my knowledge of how Python handles data internally.
First, I studied membership operators, which are in and not in. 
These operators are used to check whether a value exists inside a sequence such as a string, list, tuple, or set. 
If the value is present, the result will be True; otherwise, it will be False.
For example, I checked whether a number exists inside a list and whether a character exists inside a string. 
This helped me understand how Python searches within collections.
Next, I learned about identity operators, which are is and is not.
These operators are different from comparison operators. 
While comparison operators check whether values are equal, identity operators check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.
For example, I created two variables with the same value and compared them using both == and is.
I observed that == checks value equality, whereas is checks memory identity.
This concept gave me a small introduction to how Python manages objects internally.
I did some examples to clearly understand the difference between membership and identity operators. 
Practicing these examples helped me strengthen my understanding of object behavior and logical checking in Python.
Overall, Day 3 improved my understanding of how Python handles data comparison and object references. 
These concepts will be very useful when I start learning Object-Oriented Programming.
