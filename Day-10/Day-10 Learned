A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
It helps make programs organized and avoids repeating the same code.
Parameters are inputs given to a function. They allow the function to work with different values.
A return statement sends a result back to where the function was called so it can be used later.
Default arguments are parameters with predefined values.
If no value is given while calling the function, the default value is used.
Scope defines where a variable can be used.
A local variable works only inside a function, while a global variable can be accessed anywhere in the program.
