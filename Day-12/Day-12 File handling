File handling in Python allows us to store data permanently in a file and read it later whenever needed. 
It is useful in real-world applications like saving student records, storing bank transactions, maintaining inventory data, and many more.
The open() function is used to open a file. While opening a file, we must specify the file name and the mode. 
The mode tells Python what operation we want to perform, such as reading, writing, or appending data.
The read() function is used to read the content of a file. 
It helps us access the stored information and display or process it in our program.
The write() function is used to store data into a file. If the file is opened in write mode, it will overwrite existing content.
If it is opened in append mode, new data will be added at the end without deleting old data.
The close() function is used to close the file after completing the operations. 
Closing a file is important because it saves the changes and frees system memory.
In simple terms:
open() → Opens the file
read() → Reads data from the file
write() → Writes data into the file
close() → Closes the file
File handling is an important concept because it helps in managing data efficiently in real-world programs.
