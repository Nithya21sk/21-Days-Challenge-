Today I learned about conditional statements in Python. 
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program. 
Just like in real life we take decisions based on certain conditions, a program also needs to decide what action to perform depending on different situations. 
This decision-making process is done using conditional statements.
The most basic conditional statement is the “if” statement. It checks whether a condition is true or false. 
If the condition is true, the program executes a particular set of instructions. 
If the condition is false, it simply skips those instructions and continues with the rest of the program.
This helps in controlling the flow of execution.
Sometimes, we need two possible outcomes. In such cases, we use “if-else”. If the condition is true, one block of statements will execute; otherwise, the other block will execute. This is useful in many real-life situations like checking whether a number is even or odd, whether a student has passed or failed, or whether a person is eligible to vote.
When there are multiple conditions to check, we use “if-elif-else”. The program checks the conditions one by one. As soon as it finds a true condition, it executes that block and ignores the remaining conditions. This is very helpful in grading systems, menu selection programs, and classification problems.
Another important concept is nested conditional statements. In nested conditions, one conditional statement is placed inside another. This is useful when a second condition needs to be checked only if the first condition is true. For example, checking eligibility for a scholarship may depend on both marks and family income.
