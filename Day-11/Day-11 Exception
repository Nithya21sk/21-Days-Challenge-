On Day-11, I learned about handling errors in Python using try, except, and finally blocks. 
Exception handling helps prevent the program from crashing when an unexpected error occurs.
The try block contains code that might cause an error, and the except block handles that error gracefully. 
The finally block always executes, whether an error occurs or not.
It is mainly used for cleanup operations like closing files or displaying final messages.
I also learned about the import statement, which allows us to use built-in Python modules. 
Modules contain pre-written functions that make programming easier and faster.
One important module I explored is the math module. It provides mathematical functions such as square root, power, factorial, and constants like pi. 
By importing the math module, we can perform complex mathematical calculations easily in our programs.
Overall, Day-11 helped me understand how to write safer programs and use built-in mathematical tools effectively.
