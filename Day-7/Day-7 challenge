In Python, a string is a collection of characters written inside single or double quotes. 
Strings are used to store text like names, messages, addresses, and more. 
For example, "Hello" and "Python" are strings.
Indexing is used to access individual characters in a string.
Each character has a position number called an index. 
Indexing starts from 0.
For example, in the word "Python", P is at index 0, y is at index 1, and so on.
We can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end. 
In "Python", n is at index -1.
Slicing is used to get a part of the string.
It allows us to extract a range of characters using a start and end index. 
For example, if we take "Programming", we can slice it to get only "Program" or "gram".
Slicing helps when we want only a specific portion of text.
Python provides many string methods to perform operations on strings. 
Some common methods are:
upper() – converts text to uppercase
lower() – converts text to lowercase
strip() – removes extra spaces
replace() – replaces one word with another
find() – finds the position of a word
These methods make string handling easy and powerful.
String formatting is used to insert values into a string. Instead of joining strings manually, we can use formatting. One common way is using f-strings. 
For example, if we have a name and age, we can easily display them inside a sentence using formatting. This makes the output clear and readable.
Strings are very important in real-world programs like form validation, password checking, data processing, report generation, and chat applications.
