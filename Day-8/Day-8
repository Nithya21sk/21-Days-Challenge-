Today I learned about Lists in Python.
A list is used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate elements. 
They can store numbers, strings, or different data types together.
Each element in a list has an index, starting from 0. 
We can also use negative indexing to access elements from the end. 
Slicing helps us get a group of elements by specifying a start and end position.
I also learned list methods like append() to add an element at the end, insert() to add at a specific position, remove() to delete a value, and pop() to remove an element by index.
Finally, looping through a list allows us to access and work with each element easily.
Lists are very important for storing and managing data efficiently in Python.
