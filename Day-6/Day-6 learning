Loop statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
They help reduce repetition and make programs shorter and more efficient.
In Python, there are two main loops: for loop and while loop.
A for loop is used when we know how many times to repeat.
A while loop runs as long as a condition is true.
We can also use break to stop the loop and continue to skip one iteration. 
Loops are very important in programming because they help perform repeated tasks easily.
